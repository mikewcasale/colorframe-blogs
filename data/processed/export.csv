306,"2195 Gwynhurst Blvd, Wesley Chapel, FL, 33543",4,3,2906, N/A,Single Family Home,70 ,2013,"Price Improvement!!!!! Don't miss out on the opportunity to own a beautifully-modernized home that sits on a lot with a massive kitchen and plenty of entertaining upgrades in the acclaimed Windsor community of Meadow Pointe. Not only does this home sit on a nice pond and conservation lot, it features the most scenic views with no homes to the back and on one side of it which equates to plenty of privacy. There are endless possibilities for the set up of your outside living area and for hosting events both inside and outside of the home. The brick paved and screened lanai features a custom wooden pergola with lanterns on all four columns to set the perfect ambiance in the evening. But wait until you enter the home! Upon entrance, from the foyer, you are taken aback by the sleek appearance of the home and the massive 14 feet kitchen quartz countertop island. Look down at where you're standing and you will notice the luxurious Junckers real hardwood flooring throughout the entire home with the exception of the bathrooms and laundry room. The kitchen was completely renovated in 2018 which now features 42 inch cabinets, luxury brand BOSCH kitchen appliances, white quartz countertops with gray veins, black undermount single basin granite composite kitchen sink with Kohler sensate touchless faucet with pull-down spout, plentiful cabinet storage on both sides of the 14ft kitchen island, and metallic stone backsplash. Where else can you find a kitchen this inviting and accommodating for 12+ people to gather for breakfast/lunch/dinner? As you bypass the kitchen and continue to tour the home, you are again greeted with the beautiful views through all the sliding doors and windows that allow for natural lighting. This home has 4 bedrooms with a den that can be used as an office. The laundry room features a barn door entrance, Samsung appliances, upper cabinets and a utility sink. All bathrooms have granite countertops, but wait until you see the chandelier above the garden tub which is framed by two columns in the master bathroom. The master bathroom features double sink vanity, separate large shower, and a wet room. In the master bedroom you'll find 2 walk in closets and a sitting area near the windows so that you can bask in the beautiful sunset views in the evening from the comforts of your bedroom. Should the new owner decide to add a pool, don't worry, this home already has a pool bath with a separate door outside of one of the secondary bedrooms.

Don't miss out on the opportunity to own a beautifully-modernized home that sits on a lot with a massive kitchen and plenty of entertaining upgrades in the acclaimed Windsor community of Meadow Pointe. Not only does this home sit on a nice pond and conservation lot, it features the most scenic views with no homes to the back and on one side of it which equates to plenty of privacy. There are endless possibilities for the set up of your outside living area and for hosting events both inside and outside of the home. The brick paved and screened lanai features a custom wooden pergola with lanterns on all four columns to set the perfect ambiance in the evening. But wait until you enter the home! Upon entrance, from the foyer, you are taken aback by the sleek appearance of the home and the massive 14 feet kitchen quartz countertop island. Look down at where you're standing and you will notice the luxurious Junckers real hardwood flooring throughout the entire home with the exception of the bathrooms and laundry room. The kitchen was completely renovated in 2018 which now features 42 inch cabinets, luxury brand BOSCH kitchen appliances, white quartz countertops with gray veins, black undermount single basin granite composite kitchen sink with Kohler sensate touchless faucet with pull-down spout, plentiful cabinet storage on both sides of the 14ft kitchen island, and metallic stone backsplash. Where else can you find a kitchen this inviting and accommodating for 12+ people to gather for breakfast/lunch/dinner? As you bypass the kitchen and continue to tour the home, you are again greeted with the beautiful views through all the sliding doors and windows that allow for natural lighting. This home has 4 bedrooms with a den that can be used as an office. The laundry room features a barn door entrance, Samsung appliances, upper cabinets and a utility sink.

This 2 story 5 bedroom home on one of the two largest lots in Amhurst Oaks and is situated at the end of the cul-d-sac. This spacious home has an open floor plan with space in the front of the home for an office or a formal dining room.
