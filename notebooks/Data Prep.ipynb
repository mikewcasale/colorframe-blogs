    "For the blog article [ColorFrames: A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Assess Florida's Climate-Driven Real Estate Risk](https://medium.com/p/60e9a8913b85/edit). we will be using a new data set scraped from [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes records of over 1600 south Florida real estate properties, and includes flood risk information, demographic information, listing images, listing descriptions, how long the property has been listed, sales history, and lots of other related information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target we want to predict is the difference in the rate of property value change (regression) vs the rate of change of similar properties nearby. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, approximately 66% of properties have a low flood risk (less than 5 on the [Flood Factor](https://floodfactor.com) scoring scale), and approx. 33% have a high flood risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the hypothesis that a high flood risk score is a strong predictor for the difference in the rate of property value change by building an ML model, and then applying various model explainability tools to it."

    "Scraping data is a bit messy. Many values available on one real estate listing, might not also be found on another listing. The scaper easily gets confused with AJAX loading and other complications, therefore, we need to clean up things before we can build the model. Because it's time-consuming to clean-up everything, we will do a \"quick-pass\" here, but there will be additional data that could be cleaned in order to obtain more training data. Please feel free to do this and provide a link! \n"

    "## Merge the Zillow Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ZHVI User Guide\n",
    "One of Zillow’s most cited metrics is ZHVI, the Zillow Home Value Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us the typical home value in a given geography (metro area, city, ZIP code, etc.), now and over time. For general information about ZHVI, please refer to this methodology guide and this lighter-hearted video.\n",
    "\n",
    "When citing ZHVI, it’s important to understand how it works, including its cuts (which are like “flavors”) and naming conventions, and how to calculate common statistics with it. Here’s an overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flagship ZHVI\n",
    "\n",
    "ZHVI is calculated in a variety of cuts, consisting of different home types and adjustments. These cuts are available on Zillow Research’s data page, zillow.com/data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most-cited or “flagship” ZHVI is the all homes, middle tier, smoothed and seasonally adjusted cut. It is used by Zillow for most consumer-facing presentations of the ZHVI, such as on our Home Details Pages (the address page for most U.S. homes) and Home Values Pages (which shows ZHVI for various regions).This cut represents the middle of the market for all homes. It is smoothed to soften short-term variability, and seasonally adjusted to remove the effect of the seasonal cycle of housing (and instead focus on longer term trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Zillow’s Econ Data API, this flagship ZHVI cut is keyed with a cutTypeKey of uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same cut is also used to create the Zillow Home Value Forecast (ZHVF).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to call ZHVI\n",
    "\n",
    "ZHVI represents the “typical” home value for a region. When referring to the ZHVI dollar amount, it should be designated as the “typical home value for the region.” An earlier version of ZHVI represented a median value, but this is no longer the case. Wording should be changed to reflect the new ZHVI, and should be “typical home value” — it is NOT the “median home value”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ZHVI/ZHVF release schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "ZHVI and ZHVF are published on the Econ Data API on the third Thursday of each month. When data are released, the last valid point for ZHVI is the end of the month prior to the release month; the first month of ZHVF is the end of the month of the release month. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the third Thursday of November 2020. Data have been pushed to the API for ZHVI and ZHVF.\n",
    "The latest datapoint for ZHVI will be 10-31-2020.\n",
    "The first datapoint for ZHVF is 11-30-2020.\n",
    "The time point the ZHVI/ZHVF represents is designated in the timePeriodEndDateTime key. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are accessing ZHVI data before the third Thursday of the month, there will be a two-month data lag. For example, if you pull ZHVI data on November 10 (before the third Thursday), the last valid ZHVI point will be 09-30-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating historical and forecasted growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Yearly growth rates for ZHVI are always calculated same month to same month. For example, if you wish to display how much home values have changed over the prior year (in percentage terms), you use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "100 * [ ZHVI_{this month current year} – ZHVI_{this month last year} ] / [ ZHVI_{this month last year} ]\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the forecasted growth for the coming year, you use the same formula, but substitute  ZHVF for ZHVI for one point:\n",
    "\n",
    "100 * [ ZHVF_{this month next year} – ZHVI_{this month current year} ] / [ ZHVI_{this month current year} ]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In real estate, a `comparable` is a nearby property with similar features, such as the same number of bedrooms. In our case, for each property we merged on `zipbeds` we want to train a model to predict the difference in the rate of change of the price vs the rate of change in price for nearby comparables. To do this, we will find the `LastSoldDate` column for the target property, and lookup the corresponding ZHVI rate of change from that date until now."
